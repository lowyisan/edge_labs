"""
Top-Level Explanation:
This script captures real-time audio from a microphone using PyAudio, applies a digital bandpass filter,
and plots both the raw and filtered audio waveforms in real time. It demonstrates how to design and apply
a second-order sections (SOS) bandpass filter using SciPy, as well as how to perform real-time plotting with Matplotlib.
This is useful for lab tests on audio signal processing, filter design, and real-time visualization.

Potential Lab Test Questions:
Q1. What is the purpose of designing a bandpass filter in this script?
   A1. It allows frequencies within a specified range (here, around 19.4-19.6 kHz) to pass through while attenuating others.
Q2. Why is the Nyquist frequency used in filter design?
   A2. The Nyquist frequency (half the sampling rate) is used to normalize the cutoff frequencies for the digital filter.
Q3. How does real-time plotting work in this context?
   A3. The plots are updated in a loop using Matplotlibâ€™s canvas redrawing methods to reflect the incoming audio data.

    Designs a bandpass filter using a Butterworth filter with second-order sections (SOS).

    Parameters:
    - lowfreq: Lower cutoff frequency in Hz.
    - highfreq: Upper cutoff frequency in Hz.
    - fs: Sampling rate in Hz.
    - order: Filter order (controls the steepness of the roll-off).
