Top-Level Explanation:
This script captures video from the webcam and performs real-time Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
feature extraction using scikit-image. It converts the frames to grayscale (required by HOG),
computes HOG features along with a visualization image, enhances the visualization, and then
concatenates the original frame with the HOG visualization for side-by-side display.
This demonstration is useful for lab tests on feature extraction, image processing, and real-time
computer vision applications.

Potential Lab Test Questions:
Q1. What is HOG and why is it used?
   A1. HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) is a feature descriptor that captures edge and gradient structures,
       often used for object detection and image analysis.
Q2. Why do we convert the image to grayscale before computing HOG features?
   A2. HOG works on intensity gradients and is designed for single-channel images; converting to grayscale simplifies the
       computation and focuses on shape rather than color.
Q3. How does exposure.rescale_intensity help in visualizing the HOG image?
   A3. It rescales the HOG visualization to the 0â€“255 range, enhancing contrast and making it suitable for display.

# For pixels_per_cell:
# Increasing pixels_per_cell (e.g., from (8, 8) to (16, 16)) averages gradients over a larger area,
# resulting in a coarser, lower-dimensional feature representation with less fine detail.
# Decreasing pixels_per_cell (e.g., from (8, 8) to (4, 4)) captures more detailed gradients,
# yielding a higher-dimensional feature vector that is more sensitive to noise.

# For cells_per_block:
# Increasing cells_per_block (e.g., from (2, 2) to (3, 3)) enlarges the area for normalization,
# making the descriptor more robust to local contrast variations but potentially smoothing out subtle features.
# Decreasing cells_per_block reduces the normalization region, preserving local variations
# but might make the descriptor more vulnerable to noise.
